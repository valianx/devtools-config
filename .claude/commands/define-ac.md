   ```
3. If the command fails, tell the user: "Issue #{number} not found or `gh` is not configured. Provide the feature as text instead."
4. Pass to the `dev-orchestrator` agent:
   ```
   Direct Mode Task:
   - Mode: define-ac
   - Source: issue #{number}
   - Title: {title}
   - Labels: {labels}
   - Description: {body}
   ```

## Mode 2 — Text description

   ```
   Direct Mode Task:
   - Mode: define-ac
   - Source: text description
   - Title: {derived short title}
   - Description: {user's full text}
   ```

## Important

- **You read issues. The orchestrator does NOT** — it receives the data from you.
- Always invoke the `dev-orchestrator` agent — do NOT invoke agents directly
- The orchestrator will route to the `qa` agent in define-ac mode
- Output: acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
